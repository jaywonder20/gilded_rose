After setting up the Starter code
- The first step I took was to try and understand the way the code works before making any edits


- Then I proceeded to read the GildedRoseRequirements.txt file to fully understand what the system was meant to do and the possible edge cases that must be taken care of


- I decided to write test cases before refactoring the Code to access the current state of the code and also to ensure nothing gets broken then i start refactoring
Then I proceeded to write the Varios text cases as specified in the  GildedRoseRequirements.txt


- I Wrote 19 different test cases as I could identify from the GildedRoseRequirements file
Running the test using pytest 1 FAILED and 18 passed

- The cases that failed was the test_conjured_quality_for_double_decrease  as the current implementation didnt follow the rule that 
    - "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

- I added 3 lines of code to fix this test and ran it again to ascertain no case was violated



- Then I started the refactoring
